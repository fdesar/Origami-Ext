The RT-Perl5 directory incudes a Perl5 runtime for windows so no
more external perl installation is required. It's entirely been 
built from the Strawberry Perl project and all sources are available
(see the Readme.txt file in the directory for more informaations).

The gettext utilities and DLLs packaged here for your convenience
have been dowloaded from GNUWin32 project from their main site:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net

at the URL: 

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gettext.htm

They have been unpacked from the

"Complete package, except sources", "Setup" autoinstaller.

If you're paranoid or simply suspect something could go wrong,
you can download them from the zip package and compare their MD5
or SHA-1 signatures...

Enjoy.
