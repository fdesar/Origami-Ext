This software is under a lot of different licences, but all of them are truly Opensource
but you should have a look for each, individually, to make sure of a possible commercial
usage of them.

In case you don't know, take your own version of the individual programs and files.

Again, beside commercial use which should maybe possible, you are free to copy, use and
redistribute any part of this runtime : I choosed them specifically for that (mainly GPL and/or Artistic or compatible).
