Installation of the Origami-Ext extension on a Linux System
-----------------------------------------------------------

Your package manager is dpkg:

The install.linux script will install or remove the Origami-Ext on any Linux
system running dpkg as package manager, installing the perl modules on the
fly if they are missing and all the available translations: just follow the
prompts.

If you're unlucky and your package manager is NOT dpkg, you will unfortunatly
need to install manually the packages containing the required Perl modules(*):

  - XML::LibXML
  - Local::gettext

and then run the install script.

If you run into troubles, contact the author at <origami.ext@gmail.com>.

(*) The RPM packages are usually called respectively 'perl-XML-LibXML' and
'perl-Locale-gettext'.
