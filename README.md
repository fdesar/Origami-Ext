Origami-Ext

Inkscape Extension for Origami diagramming, written by an origamist for origamists and origami diagrammers using Inkscape
as their main vector-drawing application.

For now, it solves all of the Huzita-Hatori-Justin Axioms (1-7), the Rabbit-Ear complementary angle and
do angles/segments N-Section. Each module is self documented.

Available with fully automated install (and uninstall) scripts for Linux, Windows and MacOS  (written in Perl, it should
run virtually on any POSIX compliant system, on which Inkscape does, windows beeing an exception and needed a lot of
porting effort, as usual. Sight.).

On Windows, either Active Perl or Strawberry Perl must be installed prior to run the extension (see INSTALL.Windows).
On all other systems, Perl is already installed by default (see INSTALL.Linux & INSTALL.macos).

Localization is fully implemented and the French translation is already available.

Help very welcome for everything as translating, improving, debugging, correcting typos, doc writing... and more!

Feed back is welcome too...

Enjoy!
