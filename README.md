# Origami-Ext
Inkscape Extension for Origami diagramming, written by an origamist for origamists and origami diagrammers.

For now, it solves all of the Huzita-Hatori-Justin Axioms (1-7), the complementary angle for Rabbit-Ears and the angle N-Section.

It is in early development stage but yet available and running for Linux and Windows OSes and  very soon for OS X (written in Perl, it should run virtually on any POSIX compliant system, as Inkscape does).

Install scripts are available for this two targets.

It has localization fully implemented and the French translation is already available.

And more to come...

Help needed for everything as translating, improving, debugging, correcting typos, doc writing... and more!

Feed back welcome.

Enjoy!
