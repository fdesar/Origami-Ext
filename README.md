Origami-Ext

Inkscape Extension for Origami diagramming, written by an origamist for origamists and origami diagrammers.

For now, it solves all of the Huzita-Hatori-Justin Axioms (1-7), the Rabbit-Ear complementary angle and
the angle/segment N-Section.

Available with fully automated install scripts for Linux, Windows and MacOS  (written in Perl, it should
run virtually on any POSIX compliant system, on which Inkscape does, windows beeing an exception and needed
a lot of porting effort, as usual).

Localization is fully implemented and the French translation is already available.

Help very welcome for everything as translating, improving, debugging, correcting typos, doc writing... and more!

Feed back is welcome too...

Enjoy!
