# Origami-Ext
Inkscape Extension for Origami diagramming, written by an origamist for origamists and origami diagrammers.

For now, it solves all of the Huzita-Hatori Axioms (1-7), the complementary angle for Rabbit-Ears and the angle N-Section.

It is in early development stage but yet available and running for Linux systems and very soon for OS X (written in Perl,
it should run virtually on any POSIX compliant system). Hoping to be able to port it for Windows in the near future.

It has localization fully implemented and the French translation is already available.

And more to come...

Help needed for everything as tranlating, improving, debugging, correcting typos, installation on other OSes and evreything
else.

Enjoy!
