Installation of the Origami-Ext extension on a MacOS system
-----------------------------------------------------------

The extension will automatically install on system if Inkscape has been installed the
officially suggested way, using PerlPorts.

Just download the .zip or .tar.gz package from GitHub, uncompress it and cd into the
Origami-Ext directory created. Then run the Perl script called "install-macos.pl" which
will sudo for you and then follow the prompts.

It will automatically install the required packages from MacPorts if needed (see Note).

When the script is completed, the Origami-Ext is fully operational in your Inkscape.

If you run into troubles, contact the author at <origami.ext@gmail.com>.

In bonus, you will find in the MacOS directory an Automator application called
"Inkscape.app" you can copy in your Application directory and will make Inkscape as
easy to use as any other application. The only difference is that it won't appear as
running in your taskbar butonly in the XQuartz icon you should have in it (if you
don't, just drag it from the Application folder).

Enjoy and happy diagramming !

Note: if any port package need to be added, the command "port sefupdate" will be issued:
===== depending on how long you haven't been issuing it, it can really take a very, very
      long time. Just be patient...
