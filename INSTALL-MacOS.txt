Installation of the Origami-Ext extension on a MacOS system
-----------------------------------------------------------

The extension will automatically install on system if Inkscape has been installed the
officially suggested way, using PerlPorts(2).

Just download the .zip or .tar.gz package from GitHub, uncompress it and cd into the
Origami-Ext directory created. Then run the Perl script called "install-macos.pl" which
will sudo for you and then follow the prompts.

It will automatically install the required packages from MacPorts if needed (1).

When the script is completed, the Origami-Ext is fully operational in your Inkscape.

If you run into troubles, contact the author at <origami.ext@gmail.com>.

In bonus, you will find in the MacOS directory an Automator application called
"Inkscape.app" you can copy in your Application directory and will make Inkscape as
easy to use as any other application. The only difference is that it won't appear as
running in your taskbar butonly in the XQuartz icon you should have in it (if you
don't, just drag it from the Application folder).

Enjoy and happy diagramming !

NOTES:
======

(1) if any port package need to be added, the command "port sefupdate" will be issued:
    depending on how long you haven't been issuing it, it can really take a very, very
    long time. Just be patient...

(2) VERY IMPORTANT: In the Inscape Macports version 0.92.4, there is a significant bug:
    the module window, even having the focus, won't stay on top! If an error message or
    if you modify the canevas the module window will goo back of the main window: you'll
    have to bring it back to the top at each time. If it is because you checked the "Live
    view" button and a warning or error message is displayed, the module window will
    keep the focis and prevent you to do any further action until you bring it back
    to the top an uncheck the "Live preview" button. This is very ennoying but this
    buggy behaviour doesn't show neither in 0.92.3 or 1.00-Alpha and so won't probably
    be corrected by the MacPorts team..

(3) For Inskape users not using MacPorts (ie using Homebrew), just make sure the gettext
    tools (msgfmt, msgunfmt, msgcat and the linintl2 library) and the two Perl modules
    Locale::gettext and XML::LibXML are available on your system and the install program
    will work without any problem(3).

    For the Inkscape.app, you can edit it with automator and modify all the PATHes in the
    shell scrip part to meet your own installation.

(4) To check for msg* tools, run the bash commands:

     $ which msgfmtv  ->  path to msgfmt   => OK
     $ which msgunfmt ->  path to msgunfmt => OK
     $ which msgcat   ->  path to msgcat   => OK

    To check Perl modules:

     $ perl -e 'use Locale::gettext' -> no error message => OK
     $ perl -e 'use XML::LibXML'     -> no error message => OK

    If Local::gettext loads, the the libintl2 library is available.
