Installation of the Origami-Ext extension on a Linux System
-----------------------------------------------------------

Install on systems with DPKG (aptitude), yum or zypper.

Just run the install-linux.pl script from a console and it will install any
packages needed for your system and the extension itself.


If you're so unlucky that your package manager is not handled, you will unfortunatly
have to install manually the required packages by yourself, those providing the Perl modules XML::LibXML and Local::gettext and lastly, if missing, the one providing the
gettext utility 'msgunfmt' before running the install script.

If you run into troubles, contact the author at <origami.ext@gmail.com>.



Tested on :

Linux Mint
Ubuntu
Fedora
Suse
