Intallation on Windows
----------------------

Tested on Windows 10 Family in a 64bit VirtualBox but will probably
work on earlier versions of Windows versions (NT, 7-10) on either
32bit or 64bit systems.

The installation on Windows is fairly simple (as of v0.60).

Prerequisite:
-------------
 
 - A 32 or 64-bit Windows version (preferably Windows 10 Family)
 - You must be logging in on an account with Admin rights
 - Insckape v0.92.2 or later must be installed (mandatory)
 - the latest uncompressed version of Origami-Ext (>v0.60) (see note 1)

Installation :
--------------

From the File Explorer, go to the uncompressed Origami-Ext directory,
right click on the install-windows(.cmd) file, and choose to run it as
Admin then follow the prompts. When you see a message box popping
up telling you the installation was successful, the Origami-Ext
extension is ready to use. 

If you encounter any problem, try to run the install script again.
If you are still stuck, note all the error message(s) you get and
contact the author with as much information as possible about your
installation problem at:

 <origami.ext[at]gmail.com>.

Uninstallation:
---------------

Run again the install-window(.cmd) file as Admin and it will offer you
to fully uninstall the Origami-Ext Module. 

Enjoy and happy Origami diagramings!

Notes:
------

(1) You can download the latest version of Origami-Ext at:

    https://github.com/fdesar/Origami-Ext/releases

(2) If you wish to uninstall Inkscape, it is strongly suggested
    to uninstall the Origami-Ext module first !

(3) *** ONLY for Perl for Windows users: ***

    Whaterver version of Perl for Windows you are using, Origami-Ext by default
    installs and use its own Perl5 rutime.

    If you prefer using your own installed Perl version, which should mandatory
    include the XML::LibXML module, you can run (as Admin) the command file :

       .\Windows\RT-Perl5\usessysperl(.cmd)

     which will switch Origami-Ext to use it instead of it's own runtime which
     will be removed from the system. 

     Note that if you remove and reinstall Origami-Ext, you'll have to complete
     this procedure again as it will reinstall its runtime, ignoring your local
     Perl installation.
