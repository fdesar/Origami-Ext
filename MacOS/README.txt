CAUTION: Inkscape.app is not the Inscape application itself!!!!!

It's a simple automator application wrapper that will make Inkscape behave like
a standard application you can put in your Application Folder and link to .svg
documents, drag in your task bar, etc.

Note that it will ONLY work if your installation has been done the standard way,
using MacPorts and then your 'inkscape' and 'perl' executables lie in the
'/opt/local/bin directory', where they normally should.

Enjoy!
